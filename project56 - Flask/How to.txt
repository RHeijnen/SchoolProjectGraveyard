You should be able to run the project just fine without any problems.

Go in the flask directory and if you are on linux/mac type:
	venv/bin/python __init__.py

The project should be running on localhost:5000

if you are on windows type:
	flask\Scripts\python __init__.py

If it does not work on Windows and you get an error "missing python27.dll"
you need to install your own virtual env. To do this you need to have python 27 installed on your pc.
Next install virtual env in cmd:
	pip install virtualenv

Then go into the flask directory again and type:
	virtualenv localVenv
	localVenv\Scripts\pip install flask
	localVenv\Scripts\pip install flask-googlemaps

Then you can activate the project by typing:
	localVenv\Scripts\python __init__.py
